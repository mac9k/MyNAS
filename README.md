# MyNAS
Android App

I used Raspi 2. This is working for server.  

You can available minidlna, vftpd and transmission services in my app.
Setting the pakages in your server and connecting the port in your server.
In my case ftp : 9090,  trasmission : 9091.

FTP and Trasmission(torrent service) are simple.
However streaming service is so difficult to streaming.
FTP library is not surported streaming service.
So I solved this problem between FTP and HTTP  using proxy concept.
